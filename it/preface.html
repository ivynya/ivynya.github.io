    <p>On a day-to-day basis, I see an incredible amount of unfriendly UX/UI and code (my own included). It doesnâ€™t take a professional to improve it, and as a UX-oriented full-stack developer I believe teaching design principles for both code and user experience can help people build better software. I created Integration Testing as an ongoing series of my own insights on user experience and code architecture to highlight what can be done to improve software for everyone, from developers to end users. I hope that I can refer people to this blog for extended reading and that it may be of use to someone learning new things.</p>
